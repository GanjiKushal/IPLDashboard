1.Libraries/Frameworks Used I have used React JS for doing IPL Dashbard beacuse react consists of many inbuilt applications which will be helpful for making the app more responsive. React uses a Virtual DOM which is the biggest advantage for us so that we can reduse the loading time of the page and if a component rerenders it wont disturb the another components. By adding various packages we can add various functionlities to our web page and make it more user friendly and responsive. 2.Bonus Points a.I made web app in ReactJS. b.My webapp is mobile responsive b. I made it as a progressive webapp. c. I made it as a offline usable d.Optmized the loading time e.Used GITHUB for stroing the code
